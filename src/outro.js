// since jQuery can be concatenated with other files that may use define,
// but not use a proper concatenation script that understands anonymous
// AMD modules. A named AMD is safest and most robust way to register.
// Lowercase jquery is used because AMD module names are derived from
// file names, and jQuery is normally delivered in a lowercase file name.
